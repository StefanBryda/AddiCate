                <p>The project is developed to raise awareness that is focused on addiction, 
                which not only affects individuals who suffer from any form of addiction, but also others around them, 
                for example their families, friends and broader communities. 
                Addressing the needs of both people who are struggling with addiction and those who support them is the aim of the project, 
                by providing support and resources.</p>
