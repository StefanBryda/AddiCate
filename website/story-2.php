        <section class="story-body">
            <p>I was very, very young when I first came into contact with substances. It was mostly because my dad’s an addict. He would never admit it, though, because he functions quite well. He’s a social worker himself.<br>I was only 7 when I first got liquor and wine, and it became quite normal for me. But as the years went on, around age 11, I developed an eating disorder. For me, addiction wasn’t just about substances, so I started eating very little.</p>
            <p>My home life was complicated. On one hand, there was a lot of violence, but on the other, my dad talked to me a lot about diseases. That gave me insecurities about my body. At the same time, he’d say, “Alright, you want to lose weight? I’ll take you to the gym.” So I had to go to the gym a lot, losing even more weight, and I just couldn’t stop. It was very confusing for me. I was so young.</p>
            <p>After that, I fell into one thing after another. It wasn’t with friends, always alone at home. Sometimes I’d drink wine from morning till evening, sometimes not. I got medication from my dad, the downers mostly. Sometimes I harmed myself. For a while, I just jumped from one destructive thing to another.</p>
            <p>When I was 16, they wanted to put me in foster care, but it took a long time. Youth care eventually got involved, but the police had already been to my house 16 times. I ended up in the hospital a lot too, and once I was in an addiction clinic or a behavioral problems clinic. It didn’t help. I always came back home. When I was 18, I went back there a second time.</p>
            <p>After that, I ended up in a safe house, but I was high almost all the time. I started smoking weed, and because I met others who used different substances—through meetings and healthcare—I began using other things too.</p>
            <p>It actually stopped when I was 21. That’s when I finally found a safe situation. For the past seven years, everything has been good. My addiction and substance use were deeply tied to my situation. Nothing helped until my situation changed. I never expected that, because I’d been told over and over that I could just change my behavior if I wanted it enough, that I had to step out of the unsafe environment—that it was my biggest responsibility. But I just couldn’t see it then.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t until then that things got better.</p>
            <h4>What did the early stages feel like? </h4>
            <p>I was scared a lot. I was strong but felt stuck—I couldn’t stop, yet didn’t want to do it. I felt ashamed from a very young age. But at the same time, it felt normal. No one ever told me that drinking in the morning wasn’t normal. My dad told me it helped me relax for a math test, so having booze before school was just something I did.</p>
            <p>By age 12, healthcare workers already told me I had a lot of problems. I was always aware of it. It started with the eating disorder, which got really bad. At my worst I weighed 33 kilos, now I’m around 53 kilos. It was strange because usually people with eating disorders see themselves as fat, but I didn’t. I saw myself as normal. But I liked the feeling of being numb. And I was also scared to eat. My relationship with my dad was dependent and complicated, it was a mix of things.</p>
            <p>When I was in the hospital, I realized I had a problem with food, and I found out my granddad was a severe addict who’d been to many clinics. I linked it to genetics. That maybe it was in my family. I was never naive about it, but I was good at making excuses, telling myself, “This is just how I am.”</p>
            <p>At 18, I came to the clinic. I was running out of everything. My hands turned blue at one point. I became homeless, but not because of addiction, actually. When I was homeless, I wasn’t using anything. It was weird, but when I used it, I was dependent on others. When I started standing up for myself, like eating on my own, things got worse at home. When I was 33 kilos, I was physically abused so badly I had to go to the hospital. After I stopped using and started attending meetings, my dad kicked me out. So it was confusing and hard.</p>
            <p>I was 21 when things started to change. I was young, but it felt like I was ruining myself emotionally. I didn’t want to do bad things, but I did them anyway, even though I wanted to take care of myself. By then, it was a habit to neglect and punish myself. I had very low self-worth. I kept repeating those patterns in all areas of life. That made me anxious, depressed, and hopeless about the future. I had to work hard to turn that around.</p>
            <h4>How do you take care of yourself now?</h4>
            <p>I made an appointment with myself: every time something triggers destructive behavior, I’d respond by taking better care of myself. A woman once told me: “If you take in a sick, neglected puppy, you wouldn’t kick it or starve it. You’d care for it.” If I see myself as that puppy, I can’t punish myself for feeling pain or being unwell. That made so much sense. If I don’t feel good, I have to nurture myself instead of numbing or punishing myself.</p>
            <h4>What did addiction feel like?</h4>
            <p>I was scared all the time, afraid of dying. Like being constantly underwater, struggling to find relief. My fear of dying was partly realistic because of my home life, which made it even harder.</p>
            <h4>What helped you turn things around?</h4>
            <p>I had a lot of harsh treatment in healthcare when I was young, but what I really needed was safety, a hug, and care. I shared my recovery story in trainings and people often asked how I became addicted because my life had some safety too. I don’t have a simple answer. Now, as a stable adult, I’d say: take care of yourself, love yourself a little more, trust yourself, don’t be destructive, and set boundaries. Don’t be too harsh on yourself, you’re doing a good job just by growing.</p>
            <h4>Have you relapsed? What did you learn?</h4>
            <p>Yeah, I relapsed a few times. They were intense and short but destroyed a lot of what I’d built. It wasn’t just using, it was putting myself in dangerous situations, breaking everything, I had. Usually, I’d stop because I’d wonder why I made such a mess. Looking back, I learned that there’s something destructive inside me that wants to ruin things when life feels good or when things go wrong. Like, if something bad happens, I want to run away or quit. My relapses are examples of that pattern. It’s still there, and I’m still learning how to handle it.</p>
            <h4>What helped you stay committed after setbacks?</h4>
            <p>I started writing notes to myself, like “I have the right to exist,” or “Imperfection is perfect.” I filled my room with positive reminders. I got creative again, painting, writing, expressing myself. I developed more self-love and ownership over my life.</p>
            <p>I’m extremely sensitive, which I used to hate, but now I see it as a strength. It helps me connect with people and fuels my creativity. I’m not “overemotional,” it’s just part of me alongside my resilience and strength.</p>
            <h4>What would you say to someone to explain addiction?</h4>
            <p>For me, addiction felt like being scared all the time, drowning, searching for a moment of relief from fear.</p>
            <h4>Were there moments you felt completely alone? How did you handle it? </h4>
            <p>I’ve felt very alone from a young age. For many years, I barely spoke about my past, only with my boyfriend. People around me thought I was just the “boring girl” who didn’t even drink coffee. That made me feel isolated, especially in a high-level university environment. But when I did my master’s thesis about addiction clinics and met other experts by experience, I started opening up. That helped me feel less lonely, even if some people couldn’t handle how intense it was. Loneliness is deep inside me, and I’ve had to accept that.</p>
