        <section class="story-body">
            <p>My addiction started when I was born, I think… When I was born my lungs were not functioning properly. So the first four years of my life, I was a lot in the hospital. I was first prescribed substances back then… but by the time I realized it was a problem, it was too late. My body stopped fighting. I knew I needed to quit everything. By the time I was 22, I was already lying in the gutter. After two months, I thought, “Oh, okay, I can use sometimes, and then it’s good.” But then came another drug. That was my rock bottom, about six months before I ended up hospitalization.</p>
            <p>Six months before my hospitalization, then we had a clear moment. I thought, “Oh, I can’t stop by myself anytime.” Six months before my hospitalization was six months after… well, I don’t want to go back there. When I came over, I thought I could do everything to stay sober.</p>
            <p>I distanced myself from my family. I only had church, and my friends were also using, more than I was. So I can say they were worse than me, so I could go out with my substance-abusing friends. Emotionally, it was weird, terrible… How do you… No, I’m playing now, but maybe more later.</p>
            <p>I was always pointing to other people. Actually, I couldn’t live with myself. There was no problem outside, I just couldn’t live with myself. That’s why I said, “Oh, it’s your fault, values. It’s your fault for using.” I didn’t know that at the time, but now everything’s clear: it was because I couldn’t live with myself. When I became sober, I started working on myself. I think, “Wow, I’m a really different person, even better than before I used.” So I’m the better version of myself today.</p>
            <p>It actually doesn’t matter. When I was little, I had feelings, then I said, “Oh, today I feel ashamed.” I was working with my brother. He always called me because he wanted the best for me. But because of my substance use, I was not functioning well. Then when I came home, I said, “Oh, why is he screaming at me?” So every night, I could use again. Every time I made excuses for everything. Every time I used, I made excuses.</p>
            <p>What did I feel when I started? Full completion. Because in the first four years of my life, I was very skinny. Then when I hit… my mom said, “Good job, good job. You’re eating well.” So every time I eat now, I feel the same dopamine in my brain activate. About two years ago, I was 150 kilos. I had stomach surgery, so my relation with food is better now.</p>
            <p>The first time I used amphetamine, I was coming home. They brought me to hospitalization with GHB—I don’t know the English word, but you know. The first time I used it was with my ex. She convinced me to use it. The first time was amazing, and I wanted to do it again. But the next day, the effect was already less than the day before. Every time I used more and more, the effect was less and less.</p>
            <p>Like I said, the first real step toward change came about six months before I got sober. I worked five shifts at the factory: two mornings, two afternoons, two nights. My sleep became bad. I used drugs, but it made it worse. In the end, I couldn’t sleep no matter how much I took. That was my work bottom. I’ve been in recovery for nine months now. Before that, I was in the clinic working on myself, but I wasn’t really in recovery because I didn’t look after myself. I needed to work on myself. I always pointed the finger at others. The moment I started looking at myself was when my recovery started.</p>
            <p>What made recovery harder? Nobody’s going to help you if you don’t ask. When I’m clean now, a long time, I call people if they need help. I’m clean now, but they might not call me. So I call them and ask if they need help.</p>
            <p>When I was using it, the solution was to use again, it was the only solution in my life. When I’m sober, if I don’t feel good, I call people. I meditate. I speak with someone and it helps. My lesson is: every time I use again, it’s worse than the last time. More destructive than before. If I use today, I know in one or two months I’m gone. At the end, I was just a skin and bones. I think maybe I don’t want to go back there. That’s motivation for me not to use. Every time I look back, it’s worse and worse.</p>
            <p>How has recovery changed the way I see myself? I love myself a lot more. That’s the first thing that comes to mind. I could honestly say I love myself more. I lost two years, but now I’ve worked on myself for one and a half years. I also do affirmations for myself because I’m worth it. That helped me a lot.</p>
            <p>What strengths have I discovered? Perseverance. Every year I make a list of what I’ve learned and what my strengths are. Perseverance is the most important. I used it when I was getting substances, and now I use it for my recovery. It’s like stepping out of jail. When I became sober, it was like freedom. That’s the best description for me.</p>
            <p> If you we’re where I was, I’d say: “Use more. The more you use, the sooner you get recovery.” Recovery is the best thing that happened in my life.</p>
